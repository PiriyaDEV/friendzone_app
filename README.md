  This project will gather people that have the same interest and meet up. We virtualize the real system and experiences for this project. Which consists of creating a meetup event room, rating event, chat system and more. Users are able to redeem their points in exchange for their discount with our partners. Including a function that will analyse data for a role “analyzer” for business and marketing opportunities.
